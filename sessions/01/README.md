### Create mini-lessons

It's a form of **cooperative** learning, that is: learning from *each other, together*.

In peer learning, everybody plays both the **teacher** and the **learner**.

<!-- > Docendo discimus [By teaching, we learn] -->

By teaching to your peers, you reinforce your own learning. [It works](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects)!

Also, you get to practice and build confidence in your **communication skills**.

At the end of your mini-lessons we'll give each other **feedback**. *Honest* feedback can hurt but it's through that (and practice) that we improve.

Who | What
--- | -----------
Group 1 | What is Open Source?
Group 2 | What is HTML/CSS? Show examples!
Group 3 | What is a protocol?
Group 4 |

## Let's give each other *honest* **feedback**

#### Mini-lesson **content**   

1. How did you **plan** your mini-lesson?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*?

#### **Delivery**

1. What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson?
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
* How did your mini-lesson start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch
* Did you keep within the time?   

#### What can be **improved**?

### Introduction to the brief

The students will be divided into their usual groups of approximately four members and each group will review its investigative Project from the previous unit DMT15103, which related to a subject relevant to IP TV digital media distribution and was connected to some degree with their present work activities.

In this unit DMT15204’s group project activity, each Project group will produce a live webpage for a customer in their Project area; and each Project group member will work on a particular aspect of the customer’s requirements and implement its representation within the webpage. Each Project group will work together as a team, but the group will present contributions individually in a team format that they agree amongst themselves.

* Individual project (50%)
* Group project and website (50%)
