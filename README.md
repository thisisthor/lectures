### Project

For this project you are meant to work in teams and together collaborate on making a website with Wordpress. Each team will be allocated a topic, for which they will investigate. After the research is completed you will create bespoke content and branding material for the website.

Each team member should be allocated a role and a part of the website that they will focus on.

### Potential roles are:
* Team leader
* Branding manager
* Art director
* Content manager
* Social Media Manager
* Video producer

These are just some examples and you might come up with your own.

### You are expected to deliver:
* A research pack which justifies the design choices you have made. This research pack should include: user personas, content map, market research, mood boards, wireframes, logo examples and typography examples.
* A fully working website with bespoke content.
* Brand guidelines


## Learning goals

* To understand the principles, structures, development and management of web sites
* Develop a working knowledge of client and server-side technologies, standards and protocols
* Understand the role and requirements of hardware and infrastructure (such as servers and load-balancing requirements)
* Demonstrate proficiency in using web tools for problem solving, and in the testing, troubleshooting and de-bugging of digital media solutions.

## Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts.
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
