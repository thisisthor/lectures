# What will you learn?

* **User eXperience** (UX) design principles and patterns  
* Qualitative and quantitative **user research**
* **Competitor analysis**
* User **personas**, user **stories** and user **journey maps**
* **Interface design**: **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing**
* **Rapid prototyping** tools
* **User-testing**: face2face, A/B testing and analytics
* Motivational **copy-writing** for stickiness

### Learning goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Understand the difference between *qualitative* and *quantitative* **user research** and be familiar with a few techniques to perform both types of research.
* Research and analyse **competitor services** to gain inspiration and insight from them.
* Identify and use **design patterns** effectively in your projects.
* Produce user **personas**, user **stories** and user **journey maps** to communicate and validate your design decisions.
* Understand the importance of motivational **copy-writing** in interface design, and write interface copy that is appropriate for your audience and their task(s) at hand.
* Use **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing** techniques to visualise your interface design ideas and explore alternative solutions.
* Use **rapid prototyping** tools to quickly test solutions to specific UX problems.
* Understand the differences between various **user-testing** methods and practice them at a basic level.
* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.
* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.


# What is UX?

There are many ways of understanding **User eXperience**.

### Your turn

Read [these UX definitions](http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions) and pick your favourite one, or jot down your own definition / interpretation of UX, as you currently understand it. Later you will submit this as a part of your learning log.

# How does one design user experiences?

It usually starts with the **spark of an idea**.

It could come out of frustration using a product / system that doesn't satisfy you, it could be a random intuition that hits you while you're having a shower, it could be a commissioned request from a client...

Once you have a spark, what do you do?

### All ideas are *assumptions* that need to be tested

The UX design method we will practice is about creating **small-scale experiments** and **validating** them as quickly as possible, in loops.

![](assets/iterative-process.png)

Key words:

* **Iteration** = repeat the design-prototype-test loop (not just once)
* **Validation** = experiments inform your design choices (keep it, tweak it or scrap it)

Aka the **build+measure+learn** approach popularised by the [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/).

# The first experiment

Before you design a **solution**, it may be sensible to test if people have the **problem** you're trying to solve.

In other words, you want to observe and understand how people are currently tackling the problem you're trying to solve.

The biggest experts about your problem are the people you’re designing for.

Every project starts from **research**, aka the *discovery* phase.

Your first experiment will be **customer discovery interviews**.

### What makes a good interview?

Imagine you have an *idea*. You call your mum, explain the idea and then ask her what she thinks. What will she say?

As pleasing as it may be to hear your mum praising your idea, it doesn't give you any real insight into the idea's value. Will actual customers want it or buy it?

The [Mom Test book](http://momtestbook.com) by [Rob Fitzpatrick](https://twitter.com/robfitz) argues that often people lie to us. Not because they're evil, but because they want to be nice to you. So the challenge for you is: when talking to (potential) customers, **how do you ask them questions that lead to truthful, insightful answers?**

#### Good or bad question?

1. Would you like an app to tell you where to go on holiday based on your budget?

	- [ ] Good question
	- [ ] Bad question

 Bad question because it’s solution-oriented, closed (could be answered with a simple yes or no) and leading. You are leading people into an answer, implying that they may want a solution around budgeting holidays.

* Do you have a problem choosing where to go on holiday?

	- [ ] Good question
	- [ ] Bad question

	Better but still a bad question. It’s closed (could be answered with a simple yes or no) and leading. You are implying that people may have a problem when choosing where to go on holiday (they may not have a problem, or the problem may be elsewhere in the process).

* Talk me through how you booked your last holiday.

	- [ ] Good question
	- [ ] Bad question

This is a good question, because it’s open and unbiased. It may take you three seconds to ask, and several minutes for people to answer. Through that, you may uncover problems you had not thought of before. Also, people are better at remembering what happened recently  (your last holiday) than reflecting on more abstract topics or imagine the future.

#### Don’t talk about your idea.

#### Do let people talk about their experience and problems.

Customer discovery interviews are not about you, they are about your customers.

* Ask **open questions** that prompt them to tell *their* story and talk about *their* problems.
* Talk about **facts in the past**, not ideas for the future.
* Talk less, **listen** more.
* Work in pairs and **take notes**.
* Focus on **interactions, pains & gains**.

After the interviews, consider:

* What were the most successful questions? Why did they work?
* How could you rephrase the less successful ones to get better answers?
* Have you thought of follow-up questions?
