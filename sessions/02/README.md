# Ways of seeing

### Looking before creating

One of the key skills of a designer is the ability to look at what surrounds you and **see the possibilities** for how things can be *framed*. By *training your mind* to see these possibilities, you'll be able to recognise them when you're out with your camera.

> One should not only photograph something for what it is, but also for **what else** it is.

> [Minor White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_White), photographer

### What else could this be?

When you're about to snap a picture, or when browsing through images, always ask yourself:

*What else could this be?*

### How do we *see*?

<!--[The Stage Theory Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinsonâ€“Shiffrin_memory_model):-->

1. **Notice**   

	Our senses pick up **stimuli** and pass them on to the brain.

	In the case of vision, **light** enters our eyes and stimulates our **retina**. Notice how light that comes from the *top* of our vision field will make an impression at the *bottom* of our retina.

	The optic nerve attached to the retina transfers that *raw data* to the brain.
2. **Make sense**  

	It is the brain that *flips* visual back to their natural orientation, to form *images* and **make sense** of what surrounds us.

	When data has entered the brain, we have the option to discard it or continue thinking about it. Information stays for about 20-30 seconds in *short-term memory* before it is either forgotten or passed on to *long-term memory*.

### What is the difference between *seeing* and *looking*?

You should watch the series [Ways of Seeing](https://youtu.be/XShzabEv8bM?t=2m37s) by John Berger (and/or read [the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing)). All the following quotes come from the book.

> Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognises before it can speak.

We *see* with our eyes but we *make sense* of it with our brains.

Looking is the result of an **active decision**. We decide what to look at and what to ignore.

> Each evening we *see* the sun set. We *know* that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.

### How does our brain *make sense* of the things we see?

![](https://github.com/thisisthor/lectures/blob/DMT2018/sessions/02/assets%20/apples-cranach.jpg)

Are these apples? How do you [know](http://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/collection/paintings/renaissance/lucas-cranach-the-elder-adam-and-eve)?

* Habit
* Convention
* Past experiences
* Mental models
* Context
* Contrast (noticeable differences)
* Culture
* Taste

> Looking is less spontaneous and natural than we tend to believe [...] The way we see things is affected by what we *know* or what we *believe*.

> We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the **relation between things and ourselves**.

> But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the
surrounding world; we explain that world with words, but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by it.


### What is an *image*?

A large percentage of what we see on a daily basis are not first-hand impressions, but *images*.

[![](https://github.com/thisisthor/lectures/blob/DMT2018/sessions/02/assets%20/pipe-magritte.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)

> An image is a sight that has been **recreated** or reproduced.

### Can you see the similarities between an *eye* and a *camera*?

Why is it called [*camera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura) btw?

[![](https://github.com/thisisthor/lectures/blob/DMT2018/sessions/02/assets%20/camera-obscura.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura)


### Do you *take* a photograph or *make* a photograph?

> Every image embodies a way of seeing. Even a photograph. For photographs are not, as is often assumed, a mechanical record. Every time we look at a photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer selecting that sight from an infinity of other **possible sights**.


### Remember the mini-lessons from Monday? Well, here is more!

Who | What
--- | -----------
Group 1 | Closure & Symmetry
Group 2 | Figure/ground relationship & Connectedness
Group 3 | Proximity & Continuation
Group 4 | Similarity & Past Experience

### Present your mini-lesson

### Let's give each other *honest* **feedback** (30 min)

#### Mini-lesson **content**   

1. How did you **plan** your mini-lesson?
* What were the **key points** you wanted to get across?
* How did you decide to communicate them?
* What **assumptions** have you made about what we already know?
* How **interactive** was your mini-lesson? How was the audience meant to *participate*?

#### **Delivery**

1. What role did each **team member** play in delivering the mini-lesson?
* How did you **practice** your mini-lesson?
* How did your mini-lesson start? How did you *hook* your audience?
* What was your **body language** like? Consider facial expressions, movements of the arms, eye contact with the audience, and posture.
* What was your **voice** like? Consider speed of delivery, pausing, volume and pitch
* Did you keep within the time?   

#### What can be **improved**?

## Workshop: User personas

#### Why personas?

Whenever we design for a group of users that are not ourselves (which means, always) we make assumptions about their behaviours, goals and needs, attitudes, skills etc.  

A common tool to *get to know your assumptions* about a group of user is creating a user persona.

[Alan Cooper introduced user personas](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/05/the_origin_of_personas) as a methodology to solve the **elastic user** problem. As designers, we are tempted to stretch the user to fit almost perfectly to whatever you are designing. The vagueness of the user causes many design failures, because the user is too elastic. We therefore need something much more specific.

A user persona allows you to visualise users with **common behavioural patterns** in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, etc.

#### What dimensions are used to cluster users into a persona?

1. **Behaviours**: what users do
2. **Attitudes**: what users expect
3. **Motivations**: what users want / need
4. **Limitations**: what blocks them from doing what they want / need

**Demographics** are not really that useful.

#### Your turn

Create (at least) two user personas for your website.

Base your personas on the people who are going use your website.

If you desperately need a template, you could [use this as a starting point](http://www.ux-lady.com/diy-user-personas/) but don't just mindlessly copy it. Think of what **dimensions** will be useful in the design process.

Please no gimmicky graphs, unless they're based on research data and tell us something useful about the cluster of people they describe.

### Workshop: Website

#### Where are you with your group work?

### Workshop: Mindmap (45 min)

![connect](https://github.com/thisisthor/lectures/blob/DMT2018/sessions/02/assets%20/mindmap.png)

Create a mind-map of your learning today. We will walk around the classroom inspecting each others mind-map and give each other feedback with post-its.

### Homework

[Watch part 3 of the History of the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYkXD_cGUYU) and be prepared to be quizzed tomorrow!
