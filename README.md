# Welcome!

The World Wide Web continues to provide a foundation for the development of a broad range of increasingly influential and strategic technologies, supporting a large variety of consumer applications and services. Apprentices need to develop an understanding of how web technologies are used and applied for digital media and IP TV solutions.

## Learning goals

* To understand the principles, structures, development and management of web sites
* Develop a working knowledge of client and server-side technologies, standards and protocols
* Understand the role and requirements of hardware and infrastructure (such as servers and load-balancing requirements)
* Demonstrate proficiency in using web tools for problem solving, and in the testing, troubleshooting and de-bugging of digital media solutions.

## Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts.
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
