### Before you arrive 

1. Think about what you want your site to be called
2. Register a domain name or bring a credit card (godaddy.com is cheap and straight forward) 3. Prepare some work so we can discuss the curation 

.coms are more expensive than .co.uk ­ but still only £10 per year or so. However, there is no difference in terms of ‘weight'.

### In class we will discuss: 
1. The different platforms and off­the­shelf web creation tools2. Do you want your site to be more findable and image­led (like instagram) or more of a portfolio site with editorial copy?
